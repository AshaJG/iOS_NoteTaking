## Overview
### Description
Notetaker is an app that allows students from past and current semesters upload notes for courses that they have taken or currently are taken.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** Primarily for mobile, since we want users to take pictures however website functionality would also be easily available with examples like Chegg as one of them.
- **Story:** Analyzing user stories of students in classes and how a typical lecture is held. Being able to friend users in the same classes, or alumni of a course.
- **Market:** Mainly college students would use these notes to either make decisions on whether to take the course or just look at notes that are better than theirs
- **Habit:** This app would be looked at perhaps a couple times per week for long sessions at time due to how long reading notes would take.
- **Scope:** We would initially start with one college campus being UB, and then being able to branch out into more colleges with their courses and having them affiliate themselves with us.
